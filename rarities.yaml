# Rarities are structured as follows
# Rarity:
#     Name is used to look up the files. This gives Raritys/*.dec

#     total: <int> Required.
#         How many total of this rarity should be included per pack. This is used to see how many misc
#         slots are needed after the per-file allocations are done from the remaining cards
#     per-file: <int> This or per-file: <list> are Required
#         How many from each file should be included per pack
#     per-file: <list_of_lists> This or per-file: <int> are Required
#         This option is used if we have some subrarities we want to ensure have more in a pack
#         Consists of a list of lists with 4 elements in them. The first element of each list is a list of
#         the file names without extension to pull from. The second is how many of them should be special
#         for each pack. The third is how many you include of those special subrarities. The final is how
#         many to use of the non-special. For example:
#         [[["White", "Blue", "Black", "Red", "Green"], 1, 2, 1]]
#         says that each path should include 2 of at least 1 color and at least 1 of the rest of the colors.
#     duplication: <int> Required
#         How many copies of each card in the files should be included at this rarity
#     rem-files: <list> Optional. Defaults to empty list
#         A list of files with an effective per-file of 0. They will only be used to fill the extra slots.
